	abstract = {Modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems are powered by foundation models. This paper presents a new set of foundation models, called Llama 3. It is a herd of language models that natively support multilinguality, coding, reasoning, and tool usage. Our largest model is a dense Transformer with 405B parameters and a context window of up to 128K tokens. This paper presents an extensive empirical evaluation of Llama 3. We find that Llama 3 delivers comparable quality to leading language models such as GPT-4 on a plethora of tasks. We publicly release Llama 3, including pre-trained and post-trained versions of the 405B parameter language model and our Llama Guard 3 model for input and output safety. The paper also presents the results of experiments in which we integrate image, video, and speech capabilities into Llama 3 via a compositional approach. We observe this approach performs competitively with the state-of-the-art on image, video, and speech recognition tasks. The resulting models are not yet being broadly released as they are still under development.},

	abstract = {GPT-4o is an autoregressive omni model that accepts as input any combination of text, audio, image, and video, and generates any combination of text, audio, and image outputs. It's trained end-to-end across text, vision, and audio, meaning all inputs and outputs are processed by the same neural network. GPT-4o can respond to audio inputs in as little as 232 milliseconds, with an average of 320 milliseconds, which is similar to human response time in conversation. It matches GPT-4 Turbo performance on text in English and code, with significant improvement on text in non-English languages, while also being much faster and 50{\textbackslash}\% cheaper in the API. GPT-4o is especially better at vision and audio understanding compared to existing models. In line with our commitment to building AI safely and consistent with our voluntary commitments to the White House, we are sharing the GPT-4o System Card, which includes our Preparedness Framework evaluations. In this System Card, we provide a detailed look at GPT-4o's capabilities, limitations, and safety evaluations across multiple categories, focusing on speech-to-speech while also evaluating text and image capabilities, and measures we've implemented to ensure the model is safe and aligned. We also include third-party assessments on dangerous capabilities, as well as discussion of potential societal impacts of GPT-4o's text and vision capabilities.},

When scaled to 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervision, the resulting models generalize well to standard benchmarks and are often competitive with prior fully supervised results without the need for any dataset specific fine-tuning. When compared to humans, the models approach their accuracy and robustness. We are releasing models and inference code to serve as a foundation for further work on robust speech processing.},

	abstract = {Multi-modal large language models have garnered significant interest recently. Though, most of the works focus on vision-language multi-modal models providing strong capabilities in following vision-and-language instructions. However, we claim that speech is also an important modality through which humans interact with the world. Hence, it is crucial for a general-purpose assistant to be able to follow multi-modal speech-and-language instructions. In this work, we propose Large Language and Speech Model (LLaSM). LLaSM is an end-to-end trained large multi-modal speech-language model with cross-modal conversational abilities, capable of following speech-and-language instructions. Our early experiments show that LLaSM demonstrates a more convenient and natural way for humans to interact with artificial intelligence. Specifically, we also release a large Speech Instruction Following dataset LLaSM-Audio-Instructions. Code and demo are available at https://github.com/LinkSoul-AI/LLaSM and https://huggingface.co/spaces/LinkSoul/LLaSM. The LLaSM-Audio-Instructions dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/LinkSoul/LLaSM-Audio-Instructions.},

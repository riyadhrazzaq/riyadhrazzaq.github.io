Add all items, divide by length to calculate mean. For x, mean = 11 (rounded)</p> <h2 id="mode">Mode</h2> <p>Most common item. For x, mode = 6.</p> <h2 id="median">Median</h2> <p>The median is the middle number in a data set. Steps to find the median-</p> <ul> <li>Sort the data from low to high. For x, the sorted array is: -5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 6, 8, 13, 23, 56</li> <li>If n is odd, find the middle item. If n is even, find the middle two item and calculate their mean</li> </ul> <p>Here, since n is 11, 6th item is the median = 6.</p> <h2 id="quartile">Quartile</h2> <p>Quartiles are values that divide the data in 4 regions. The regions are known as the lowest 25% of numbers, next lowest 25% of numbers(up to median), second highest 25% of numbers (above median), the highest 25% of numbers. So to have 4 region, we need 3 points called as Q1,Q2,Q3. In layman’s term, the Q1 is greater than or equal to the lowest 25% of the number and so on. To calculate quartiles, data have to be sorted.</p> <h3 id="1st-quartile">1st Quartile</h3> \[Q_{1}=\left(\frac{n+1}{4}\right)^{th}term\] <p>For x, Q1 = 2</p> <h3 id="2nd-quartile">2nd Quartile</h3> <p>It’s the same as median which is 6.</p> <h3 id="3rd-quartile">3rd Quartile</h3> \[Q_{3}=\left(\frac{3}{4}(n+1)\right)^{th}term\] <p>For x, Q3 = 13</p> <h2 id="variance">Variance</h2> <p>It explains how far the data is spread out from their mean. Calculated as the average of the squared difference from the mean. For x, do \((2-11)^{2}+ (6-11)^{2} + .... + (23-11)^{2}\) and finally divide the sum by 11. Result is, 247.90</p> <h2 id="standard-deviation-sd">Standard Deviation (SD)</h2> <p>This is simply the square root of variance. Explains if a number is normal or not, a number can be big or small compared to the other items of the dataset. SD tells us how tightly the data is clustered around the mean. A small SD indicates that the data is tightly clustered. A large SD tells that the data is more spread apart.</p> <hr> <p>Visit the following for more knowledge:</p> <ul> <li>https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com</li> </ul> </body></html>

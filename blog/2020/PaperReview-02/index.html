Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 2006.</p> <h3 id="takeaway-message-from-the-paper">Takeaway Message From the Paper</h3> <p>Keyword extraction problem presented as classification problem.</p> <h3 id="what-is-the-motivation-for-this-work-both-people-problem-and-technical-problem-and-its-distillation-into-a-research-question">What is the motivation for this work (both people problem and technical problem), and its distillation into a research question?</h3> <p>Statistical Method such as Tfidf etc are less efficient in keyword extraction. Also, some methods uses defined words/phrases to use as keywords in new document. This restricts the possibility to find better words/phrases for keyword. Proposed method solves this.</p> <h3 id="what-is-the-proposed-solution-hypothesis-idea-design">What is the proposed solution (hypothesis, idea, design)?</h3> <p>If any tags can be labeled as good or bad, then the input -&gt; label can be trained using ML algorithms. Authors used training set’s keyword/phrases’ feature vector as input. Label as output. And finally, from test document, used tri-gram method to select some number of word/phrase, turned them into feature vector, passed them to the trained model, got the label. If it’s good, then used as a tag/keyword, else discarded.</p> <h3 id="what-is-the-authors-evaluation-of-the-solution-what-logic-argument-evidence-artifacts-eg-a-proof-of-concept-system-or-experiments-are-presented-in-support-of-the-idea">What is the author’s evaluation of the solution? What logic, argument, evidence, artifacts (e.g., a proof-of-concept system), or experiments are presented in support of the idea?</h3> <p>Better result in the experiment, also showed that this resulted keywords helps to classify document compared to other method without keyword.</p> <h3 id="what-are-the-papers-contributions-authors-and-your-opinion-ideas-methods-software-experimental-results-experimental-techniques">What are the paper’s contributions (author’s and your opinion)? Ideas, methods, software, experimental results, experimental techniques…?</h3> <p>The idea to present word/phrase selecting problem as classification problem. I, myself thought input should be the document. But this is more neat and faster on the memory.</p> <h3 id="what-are-future-directions-for-this-research-authors-and-yours-perhaps-driven-by-shortcomings-or-other-critiques">What are future directions for this research (author’s and yours, perhaps driven by shortcomings or other critiques)?</h3> <p>word/phrase to feature vector can be done better now, with algos such as word2vec, glove.</p> </body></html>

Keyword extraction is done to achieve keyphrase extraction.</p> <h3 id="what-is-the-proposed-solution-hypothesis-idea-design">What is the proposed solution (hypothesis, idea, design)?</h3> <p>Input layer of the deep recurrent neural network is word embedding, first hidden layer extracts keyword, second hidden layer determines whether that keyword is single keyword, beginning of a keyphrase, middle of keyphrase, end of a keyphrase or not part of the keyphrase.</p> <h3 id="what-is-the-authors-evaluation-of-the-solution-what-logic-argument-evidence-artifacts-eg-a-proof-of-concept-system-or-experiments-are-presented-in-support-of-the-idea">What is the author’s evaluation of the solution? What logic, argument, evidence, artifacts (e.g., a proof-of-concept system), or experiments are presented in support of the idea?</h3> <p>Comparison was done with other methods. Proposed work resulted in better score.</p> <h3 id="what-are-the-papers-contributions-authors-and-your-opinion-ideas-methods-software-experimental-results-experimental-techniques">What are the paper’s contributions (author’s and your opinion)? Ideas, methods, software, experimental results, experimental techniques…?</h3> <p>Jointly extracting the keyword and keyphrase using Joint Layer Recurrent Neural Networks.</p> <h3 id="what-are-future-directions-for-this-research-authors-and-yours-perhaps-driven-by-shortcomings-or-other-critiques">What are future directions for this research (author’s and yours, perhaps driven by shortcomings or other critiques)?</h3> <p>Since the model is a bit complex, I had expected the result would be much higher, around 90%. Has to find out why the score is lower than expected.</p> </body></html>
